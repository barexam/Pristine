# Pristine
The first thing I do on a new (pristine) Linux box is set up my shell (<code>zsh</code>), and my editor (<code>vim</code>).

It's annoying to have to set these up each time, with the copying of the configs and such, so this project basically keeps it all together in one directory and puts it into place with the setup script.

## Usage

1. Download the repo to your home directory on the new box.
2. Run the setup script to install zsh and move the files to your home directory. I recommend reading the script first; it's not a great idea to run random scripts without reading them.

Once you restart your shell you should have clean shell and edtior configurations.

Enjoy!
